My attitude towards any technology is, “I don’t know it all, but I will figure it out”. I find technology fascinating due to its vast ever-changing nature. 
There is so much to investigate. Every day I come to work, I find out I know less. This keep my learning spirit alive.
Learning and Teaching, my passion keeps me involved in teaching and mentoring Information Technology for more than 25 years.
